Project on Data Structures and Algorithms for the course "DATA STRUCTURES" of the fourth semester of CEID.
Given two text files (hum.txt & temp.txt) we had to implement some of the most common data Structures(Lists,Binary Trees ect) 
and Sorting Algorithms(Counting Sort,Interpolation Sort) to perform certain actions such as Sorting,Accessing and Deleting Information and more.
All code is written in C++ on XCode.
